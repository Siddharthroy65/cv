           <p>This is biryani in its vegetarian avatar that tastes just as good.
             Fried paneer cubes doused in a creamy gravy,
              layered with rice and cooked 'dum' style. The delight is quite flavourful.</p>

                 <li> Mushroom Kofta in Tomato Gravy</li>
                 <p>This recipe is a crowd pleaser. Plump mushrooms stuffed with spinach and paneer,
                    and then dipped in a tangy tomato gravy.
                   The tomato gravy is a little thick, and therefore you  can pair it
                     with chapatis or even parathas. </p>

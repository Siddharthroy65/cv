      <p>Put sugar in glass. Cover it with dashes of bitters. Add whiskey and stir until sugar dissolves. Add ice, stir again,
        and serve. If the barman starts shaking the ingredients or muddling fruit, have your next round at another bar.</p>

        <li>Dark and Stormy</li>
        <p>Sweet and sharp, the Dark and Stormy climbed out of the Bermuda
           Triangle to become one the most popular Caribbean rum cocktails you can make.</p>

           <li>Gimlet</li>
           <p>Rose's lime cordial is perfectly balanced
             by herbaceous dry gin in this tart, impossible-to-screw-up British cocktail.</p>

             <li>Moscow Mule</li>
              <p>This cocktail is crisp and cooling, and good for any season. Plus it (usually) comes in a copper mug, which is neat.</p>

              <li>Aperol Spritz</li>
              <p>For daytime drinking, you really can't beat an Aperol Spritz. It's pretty basic, but then again, that's its
                 charm. Just ask all the bar patrons crowding the patio around you, Spritzes in hand.</p>

                 <li>Mojito</li>
                 <p>Really, it's difficult to imagine a combination more refreshing than rum,
                    lime, mint, and bubbles. We have Cuba to thank, and thank heartily, for the Mojito</p>

      <li>Vada Pav</li>
      <p>The most popular street food from Mumbai, so much so that Mumbai is almost synonymous to Vada Pav.
        It is basically Batata Vada sandwiched between slices of Pav along with a generous amount of sweet and spicy chutneys.
        It might seem like a lot of hard work but its actually pretty quick and easy to make at home.</p>

           <li> Bombay Duck</li>
           <p>Contradictory to what the name suggest, Bombay duck, or Bombil, isn't really duck;
             it is in fact a very fleshy fish found only in the waters around Mumbai.
              It has a special place in the hearts of Parsis.</p>

                 <p>Bibik or bebinca, is a traditional Goan dessert influenced by the popular Indo-Portuguese culture.
                    A delectable layered pudding with multiple thin coconut-flavoured layers divided by clarified butter.
                    Preparing this West Indian dessert is a task of patience,
                   but well worth of it all. Being the only dessert unique to Goa, it is known as the 'queen of Goan desserts'.</p>
